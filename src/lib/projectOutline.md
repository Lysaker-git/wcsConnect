## Supabase Database Structure
- **Tables Needed:**
  - `users`: User profiles, roles, approval status
    - **Relations:**
      - One-to-many with `events` (a user can organize many events)
      - One-to-many with `rsvps` (a user can RSVP to many events)
      - One-to-many with `messages` (a user can post many messages)
      - One-to-many with `payments` (a user can make many payments)
      - One-to-many with `organizer_applications` (a user can apply to be an organizer)
  - `events`: Event details (title, description, type, location, time, banner, capacity, organizer_id, approval status)
    - **Relations:**
      - Many-to-one with `users` (organizer_id references users.id)
      - Many-to-one with `regions` (region_id references regions.id)
      - One-to-many with `rsvps` (an event can have many RSVPs)
      - One-to-many with `messages` (an event can have many messages)
      - One-to-many with `payments` (an event can have many payments)
      - Many-to-one with `event_types` (event_type_id references event_types.id)
  - `regions`: List of regions/cities for filtering
    - **Relations:**
      - One-to-many with `events` (a region can have many events)
  - `rsvps`: User RSVPs for events (user_id, event_id, status)
    - **Relations:**
      - Many-to-one with `users` (user_id references users.id)
      - Many-to-one with `events` (event_id references events.id)
  - `messages`: Event message board threads (event_id, user_id, content, timestamp, parent_id for replies)
    - **Relations:**
      - Many-to-one with `users` (user_id references users.id)
      - Many-to-one with `events` (event_id references events.id)
      - Self-referencing for threads (parent_id references messages.id)
  - `payments`: Payment records (user_id, event_id, amount, method, status, timestamp)
    - **Relations:**
      - Many-to-one with `users` (user_id references users.id)
      - Many-to-one with `events` (event_id references events.id)
  - `event_types`: (optional) For extensibility of event categories
    - **Relations:**
      - One-to-many with `events` (an event type can have many events)
  - `organizer_applications`: For tracking organizer approval workflow
    - **Relations:**
      - Many-to-one with `users` (user_id references users.id)

- **Recommended:** Use Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection.

## Branching Strategy & Versioning

### Branch Naming Conventions
- **main**: Stable, production-ready code.
- **dev**: Integration branch for features before merging to main.
- **feature/<feature-name>**: For new features (e.g., feature/event-creation, feature/payment-integration)
- **bugfix/<short-description>**: For bug fixes (e.g., bugfix/rsvp-status-update)
- **hotfix/<short-description>**: For urgent fixes to production (e.g., hotfix/payment-error)
- **docs/<short-description>**: For documentation updates (e.g., docs/update-readme)
- **test/<short-description>**: For testing-related changes (e.g., test/add-event-tests)

### Versioning Guidelines
- Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
  - **MAJOR**: Breaking changes or major new releases (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
  - **MINOR**: New features, backwards compatible (e.g., 1.1.0 → 1.2.0)
  - **PATCH**: Bug fixes, small improvements (e.g., 1.1.1 → 1.1.2)
- **Recommended:**
  - Bump MINOR version for each significant feature (e.g., event creation, payments, messaging)
  - Bump PATCH version for bug fixes or minor enhancements
  - Only bump MAJOR for breaking changes or major refactors
- Tag releases in main branch (e.g., v1.0.0, v1.1.0)

### Example Workflow
1. Create a new branch from dev: `git checkout -b feature/event-creation dev`
2. Work on the feature, commit changes.
3. Open a pull request to dev for review.
4. After testing, merge to dev.
5. When dev is stable and ready for release, merge to main and tag with the new version.
